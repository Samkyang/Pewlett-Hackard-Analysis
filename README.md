3. There was a total of 43378 job switches or promotions. I counted the amount of employess in the retirement_titles (133,776) and subtracted that count from the unique_titles (90,398) table.
4. There will be mostly Senior Engineers and Senior Staff retiring. So efforts to fill those gaps Recruiting can focus on hiring for those roles or a mentorship program will be needed in order to help devlope and promote employees from within.
#### Analysis 2: Determine the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program
1. The total number of eligble employees for the mentorship program is 1549

4. This mentorship program wont work because there are far more potential mentees than there are potential mentors. The parameters will have to be changed to select mentors.


## Summary
    1. There will be 90,398 empoloyees retiring and will need to be filled due to the "Silver Tsunami"
        a. The amount of people retiring by department is as follows

    2. These are the amount of mentors each job title will have pales in comparison to the number of total employees there are. Also this is a poor way to compare and set up mentorship.

 Why would somebody want a mentor who is a mentor just because they are older. It should be based off of time in the company and for the title above.
